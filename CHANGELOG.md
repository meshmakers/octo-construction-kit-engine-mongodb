## Unreleased

- AB#8962 Fix: downsampling a time-range archive over a window that does not start on a stored window start (a
  relative "last N days" ending at now) returns the stored values again. The bin axis started at the raw `From`
  (AB#7659), so every 15-minute bin straddled two stored windows and the fully-contained predicate dropped all of them:
  resolution-aware line charts on raw time-range archives stayed empty until the resolver switched to a rollup
  (~9 days). The engine now probes the phase of the stored windows in range (`window_start` modulo the window length,
  `MIN`/`MAX` over the same source filters). When they share one phase, it snaps the origin down to the last window
  start at or before `From` (windows at :05/:20/... keep their phase). The first bin may start up to one window before
  `From` and the axis may have one bin more, as on rollups. Requests that already start on a window start, rollups and
  raw archives are unchanged. With no window in range, or with series stored at different phases, the axis starts at
  `From` as before; there, windows of a phase other than `From`'s that straddle a bin edge are still dropped. The fix
  adds one cheap aggregate query per time-range downsampling. The grain route also normalises `From`/`To` to UTC
  (`ToUniversalTime`, as the SQL literals do) before it computes the bin count.
- AB#8895 New: a runtime-entity query that asks only for the total count counts on the server without loading any
  document. `ITenantRepository.CountRtEntitiesByTypeAsync` (type query) and `CountRtEntitiesGraphByTypeAsync` (type
  query with navigation pairs, as persistent queries use) run `$match` - plus the geospatial stage and the association
  stages that navigation filters need - followed by `$count`; no sort, no `$facet`, no enrichment `$lookup`, no entity
  is materialised. The count equals the `TotalCount` of `GetRtEntitiesByTypeAsync` / `GetRtEntitiesGraphByTypeAsync`
  with the same options, data permissions of the caller included (count parity tests per query shape). Additive: two
  new interface members, implemented here; existing queries are unchanged. Before, an unpaged query that only needed
  the count loaded every matching document (ASSET1002 OUT_OF_MEMORY on large entities, AB#8793).
